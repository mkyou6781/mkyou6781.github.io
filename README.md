MSc in Mathematical modelling and scientific computing at the University of Oxford

## About
I am a master's student studying mathematical modelling (modelling complicated phenomena with simple mathematics) and scientific computing (numerically analysing differential equations) at the University of Oxford with a background in Physics at the University of Cambridge. I am particularly interested in statistical physics, soft condensed matter and fluid dynamics. I am passionate about discovering the mysteries of biological pattern formation with physics and mathematical modelling. The particular  topics of interest are phase separation, statistical physics of biological system and mechano-chemical feedback.

Most of the previous research experience focused on scientific computing and fluid dynamics. As for scientific computing, I have conducted two summer internships involving computing in Python: simulating the Darwinian evolution of simple chemical networks at Furusawa lab at the University of Tokyo and developing computational tool to estimate ecosystem function at Sony Computer Science Laboratory. I have been further enhancing my skills in my master's course. As for fluid dynamics, I have done three projects: a literature review project about canopy wave, particularly on the interaction between fluid instability and harmonic oscillators, a summer project about the acoustic property of porous material and a mini-project about microswimmer in the master's course.

## EDUCATIONS

* University of Oxford (October 2023-Present (Ending in September 2024))
    * Msc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing
* University of Cambridge
    * BA (Honours) Natural Sciences (Physical)
    * Third Year: Physics (Second class division 1)

## INTERNSHIPS/ WORK EXPERIENCE

* Internship at Multifunctional Materials Design research group, Aalto University (Helsinki, Finland) July 2023 - September 2023

I studied the sound absorption of pectin cryogels by integrating simple modelling of the material and computational fluid dynamics simulation with Comsol Multiphysics and image processing with ImageJ. I presented my work as a poster in the symposium on the Acoustics of Poro-Elastic Materials 2023.

* Internship at Sony Computer Science Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan) July 2022 - September 2022

I got involved in the project “Synecoculture” ( https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/tokyo/407/), aiming to make a new style of sustainable agriculture based on ecosystem dynamics. I developed a computational tool to estimate the ecosystem service from the plant distribution and plant trait database with Python, Pandas, Excel and Github.

* Internship at Furusawa lab at University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan) September 2021

I simulated the Darwinian evolution of simple chemical reaction networks by implementing numerical integration with SciPy. The data was analysed by statistical methods such as PCA to see whether there was a direction in which the phenotype is likely to change. The code is available at the following link: https://github.com/mkyou6781/intership_2021_summer

## VOLUNTEERING AND EXTRACURRICULARS

* Filming Officer in Cambridge University Physics Society (Cambridge, UK) Oct 2022-June 2023 

As a committee member of the student-led physics society, I recorded and streamed the talks on YouTube to make it accessible to everyone who is interested. Across the duration of my duty, we achieved 67,000 views and 850 new subscribers.

* Interdisciplinary High School Research Program (Tokyo, Japan) Dec 2021- Present 

We organise a research program for Japanese high school students to promote interdisciplinary research addressing social issues related to water. I was responsible for organising workshops, which included inviting academics and managing the team to ensure the workshops ran smoothly and were fruitful for the participants.

* Public lecture with Tobitate Study Abroad Initiative (online, Japan) Jan 2022 

I gave a lecture to Japanese high school students in simple English about plant biology, based on the lecture course I took in the first year undergraduate. The event was run by the Tobitate Study Abroad Initiative, which is led by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.
