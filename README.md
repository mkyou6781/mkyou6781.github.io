## Master's student MSc in Mathematical modelling and scientific computing at University of Oxford## Education* University of Oxford (October 2023-Present (Ending in September 2024))    * Msc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing* University of Cambridge    * BA (Honours) Natural Sciences (Physical)## INTERNSHIPS/ WORK EXPERIENCE* Internship at Multifunctional Materials Design research group, Aalto University (Helsinki, Finland) July 2023 - September 2023I researched hierarchically porous biomaterial-based acoustic absorbents. I studied the sound absorption ofpectin cryogels by integrating simple modelling of the material and computational fluid dynamics simulation with Comsol Multiphysics and image processing with ImageJ. I presented my work as a poster in the symposium on the Acoustics of Poro-Elastic Materials 2023.* Internship at Sony Computer Science Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan) July 2022 - September 2022I got involved in the project “Synecoculture” ( https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/tokyo/407/), aiming to make a new style of sustainable agriculture based on ecosystem dynamics. I developed a computational tool to estimate the ecosystem service from the plant distribution and plant trait database with Python, Pandas, Excel and Github.* Internship at Furusawa lab at University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan) September 2021I simulated the Darwinian evolution of simple chemical reaction networks by implementing numerical integration with SciPy. The data was analysed by statistical methods such as PCA to see whether there was a direction in which the phenotype is likely to change.
